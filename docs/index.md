# Mapping Bus Routes

Documentation for communities along the Trufi Association stream. All documents should be easy to understand, involve some graphics and should be kept as short as possible and the images not to small.


## Setting up your workspace

## Basics

[**Understanding relations**](understanding-relations/index.md)
In order to map the infrastructure of public transportation systems we need to understand relations first. Graphics dominate here!

[**Split ways into one or two**](split-ways/index.md)

## Routes on OSM

[**Adding bus stops or waiting positions for the passengers**](adding-bus-stops/index.md)
Documents how to map bus stops and waiting positions and explains the difference between them. _Some communities do not require you to map bus stops or the waiting positions. In some cases they do not require both mapping practises e.g. in cities without bus stops_

[**Mapping bus routes**](mapping-routes/index.md)
Here all comes together. This is the part why you're probably here. This covers how to map routes in JOSM to add to OpenStreetMap.
