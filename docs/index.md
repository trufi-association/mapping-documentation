# Trufi Documentation

Documentation for communities along the Trufi Association stream. All documents should be easy to understand, involve some graphics and should be kept as short as possible and the images not to small.

## Community managers!

**JUST FOR COMMUNITY MANAGERS:** You should follow the guide [on the repository there](https://github.com/trufi-association/routemapping_josmconfig) to set up a tool that makes it easier to map bus routes in JOSM. With this in hand the documentation here will be a lot more effective and more hassle free for your community.

## Community members!

**THIS SECTION IS FOR THE COMMUNITY OR PEOPLE WORKING FOR THEM.**
