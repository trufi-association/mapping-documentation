# Installing JOSM on Windows 

We will cover here how to install JOSM on Windows. You need to install Java prior to following this tutorial otherwise you won’t be able to execute JOSM.

1. Go to https://josm.openstreetmap.de
2. Download [josm-tested.jar](https://videos.openstreetmap.de/kategorien/Basics/Changesets.mkv) (external link).

3. Save it somewhere on your disk.
4. Execute JOSM by double clicking on its file.
   **If nothing happens over 10 seconds (depending on your hardware) that means probably you haven’t Java installed or the file association *.jar* not properly set.**
